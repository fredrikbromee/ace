# Project Instructions for Cursor

## Web Server Usage
- **DO NOT** start Python web servers (e.g., `python -m http.server`, `python3 -m http.server`) to serve HTML files or any other static files
- The user uses VS Code's built-in Live Server extension for serving files
- When testing HTML files like `index.html`, assume the user will use their own Live Server setup
- Never suggest or automatically run commands to start web servers

## File Serving
- Static files (HTML, CSS, JS) should be opened directly via Live Server in VS Code
- Do not create or suggest server startup scripts
- Do not modify code to require a server unless explicitly requested
